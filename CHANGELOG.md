## Release Notes

### Version 0.0.1

The first official release of Multi-Language Lorem Ipsum Generator brings comprehensive multi-language placeholder text generation to VS Code. This release focuses on providing high-quality, contextually relevant lorem ipsum text across 9 major world languages, organized into 6 professional topic categories.

**Key Highlights:**

- 🎉 First public release
- 🌏 Multi-language support from day one
- 📂 Topic-based categorization for realistic content
- 🎲 Anti-repetition system with multiple variations
- 📖 Professional documentation and examples

**Why This Matters:**
Traditional lorem ipsum generators only provide Latin text, which doesn't reflect real-world, multilingual projects. This extension bridges that gap by offering authentic placeholder text in the languages you actually use, with content that matches your project's industry or domain.

**What's Next:**
We're actively working on expanding language support, adding more categories, and implementing AI-powered text generation for even more variety and customization options.
